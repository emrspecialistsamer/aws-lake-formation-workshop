AWS Lake Formation relies on the interaction of several components to create and manage your data lake.

<h4 style="color:orange !important;">Data Lake</h4>
The data lake is your persistent data that is stored in Amazon S3 and managed by Lake Formation with a Data Catalog.

<h4 style="color:orange !important;">Data Importer</h4>
A data importer is a processing construct that defines the data source and schedule to ingest data into your data lake. It contains AWS Glue crawlers, jobs, and triggers that are used to orchestrate the processes to load and update the data lake.
