   <h5>Create S3 bucket in your account and upload metadata file.</h5>
   
   <br/> 
   1. Create S3 bucket and name it as <b>auth0-account-id-metadata</b>, replace <b>account-id</b> with your AWS account.
   <br/><br/>
   2. Upload metadata xml file you downloaded from <b>Auth0</b> for LakeFormation Application into S3 bucket you just created above, and make a note of S3 path to this file 
   as we need this during AWS CloudFormation Stack creation as one of the input.
