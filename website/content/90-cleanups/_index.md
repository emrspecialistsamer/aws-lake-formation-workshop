<div style="text-align: justify">
When you have finished with this workshop, remember to clean up all those AWS resources ( you may have to manually delete the S3 buckets as some of the buckets won't get deleted if the buckets are not empty through AWS CloudFormation ) that you created using AWS CloudFormation. Use the AWS CloudFormation console or AWS CLI to delete the stack named <b>Lake-Formation-WF</b>.
